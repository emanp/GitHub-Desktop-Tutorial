#### Step 1: Initializing GitHub

1. Go to the repository link: https://github.com/emanp/psy484_hw3 

2. Click the green 'code' icon:

3. Copy the link:

4. In GitHub Desktop, click File -> Clone Repository: ![9EF1ADFD-0C71-4680-812B-13CD188B20E6_4_5005_c](/Users/epelayo/Pictures/Photos Library.photoslibrary/resources/derivatives/masters/9/9EF1ADFD-0C71-4680-812B-13CD188B20E6_4_5005_c.jpeg)

   

5. A window will open. Navigate to 'URL' and enter the URL you copied in step 3 and choose where you want to save the project.

6. Congrats! You have successfully cloned a repository. You should see a similar screen to this:

   ![CA984767-3FD3-486A-B041-51AE433DF3B7_1_201_a](/Users/epelayo/Pictures/Photos Library.photoslibrary/resources/renders/C/CA984767-3FD3-486A-B041-51AE433DF3B7_1_201_a.jpeg)

   

7. On the top-right, click 'Fetch Origin':

   ![CA984767-3FD3-486A-B041-51AE433DF3B7_1_201_a](/Users/epelayo/Pictures/Photos Library.photoslibrary/resources/renders/C/CA984767-3FD3-486A-B041-51AE433DF3B7_1_201_a.jpeg)

   

8. Go to where you saved the project. In my case, I saved it in Desktop:

   ![9C133457-5B0B-499A-A72E-9B1382546CF6_1_201_a](/Users/epelayo/Pictures/Photos Library.photoslibrary/resources/renders/9/9C133457-5B0B-499A-A72E-9B1382546CF6_1_201_a.jpeg)

   **If it's there, you are all done**!

   

#### Step 2: Accessing the project from Unity

1. Open Unity Hub

2. Click Add -> Add Project From Disk. Click on the psy484_hw3 you just saved and click on the 'hw2' folder inside of it. This is the folder containing the project. : 

   ![DA5E5027-3241-40CF-BB4D-B145A52A437E_1_201_a](/Users/epelayo/Pictures/Photos Library.photoslibrary/resources/renders/D/DA5E5027-3241-40CF-BB4D-B145A52A437E_1_201_a.jpeg)

   ![B29DB447-A2E1-4D37-B3B2-8FF09969E0CF_1_201_a](/Users/epelayo/Pictures/Photos Library.photoslibrary/resources/renders/B/B29DB447-A2E1-4D37-B3B2-8FF09969E0CF_1_201_a.jpeg)

   

3. You should now see the project in Unity Hub: 

   ![FEC3CE7F-373B-461F-ABF6-018E8E25056F_1_201_a](/Users/epelayo/Pictures/Photos Library.photoslibrary/resources/renders/F/FEC3CE7F-373B-461F-ABF6-018E8E25056F_1_201_a.jpeg)

   

4. Click on the project to open it. After a bit of loading, a new window should appear: 

![BA134993-696C-4137-9192-9CFD8512592E_1_201_a](/Users/epelayo/Pictures/Photos Library.photoslibrary/resources/renders/B/BA134993-696C-4137-9192-9CFD8512592E_1_201_a.jpeg)

**Congrats! You are all set to develop in Unity.**



#### Step 3: Adding our changes 

Your teammates need your changes! Let's add them to GitHub so your teammates can access them.

1. Now let's make a change! In this example, all I did was add a simple text file. 

2. Go back to GitHub Desktop. You should see the new file appear: 

   ![19DAB905-14E8-4A9B-ABA8-36A90F6E33E6_1_201_a](/Users/epelayo/Pictures/Photos Library.photoslibrary/resources/renders/1/19DAB905-14E8-4A9B-ABA8-36A90F6E33E6_1_201_a.jpeg)

   

3. In the bottom left, click on the text box and type a few words about what  you added/did, and add a description if desired. (ex. "Added controller walking functionality")

4. Click "Commit": 

   

   

5. We are not done yet! We need to upload, or 'Push' these changes to GitHub. To do this, go to the upper right and press 'Push Origin': 

   ![FCE3AF7F-0BD4-4E11-8BCE-C8CC0D31AA03_1_201_a](/Users/epelayo/Pictures/Photos Library.photoslibrary/resources/renders/F/FCE3AF7F-0BD4-4E11-8BCE-C8CC0D31AA03_1_201_a.jpeg)

   

6. All done! Go back to the repository link and refresh. You should now see what you added:

   ![215ECB70-AD99-4886-984C-FA15EC105F99_1_201_a](/Users/epelayo/Pictures/Photos Library.photoslibrary/resources/renders/2/215ECB70-AD99-4886-984C-FA15EC105F99_1_201_a.jpeg)

   

**Note: Do this after every feature you implement, but let your teammates know first to avoid problems. **

**Note 2: Ideally, one would not push to 'main' all the time. But for now, since we are working in sequential order, and it is a small project, we are okay with pushing to 'main.' In the future, we will go over something called 'branches' which should resolve most issues. **



#### Important: Accessing changes someone else has added

You also need your teammate's changes! Let's download, or 'pull' them.

1. Go to GitHub Desktop and click 'fetch origin':

   ![451E6C8A-C948-4BA9-812C-2EBCE0B9A425_1_201_a](/Users/epelayo/Pictures/Photos Library.photoslibrary/resources/renders/4/451E6C8A-C948-4BA9-812C-2EBCE0B9A425_1_201_a.jpeg)

   

2. That same button should change to 'pull origin'. Click it again. 

   ![FCE3AF7F-0BD4-4E11-8BCE-C8CC0D31AA03_1_201_a](/Users/epelayo/Pictures/Photos Library.photoslibrary/resources/renders/F/FCE3AF7F-0BD4-4E11-8BCE-C8CC0D31AA03_1_201_a.jpeg)

   

3. Wait for a bit while your project gets updated to include the incoming changes. 

   

**All done! Open the project in Unity and you should see the changes that were made.**



#### Helpful tips: 

- Always 'pull' before starting to work on something!

- Communicate!
